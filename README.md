## üåê The Problem : World Needs More Food Trucks!

A team in San Francisco are on a quest to discover the hidden gems of street food, particularly food trucks! The challenge is to to make it possible for the team to find a food truck no matter where our work takes us in the city.

The minimal requirement for this API is that it give us at least 5 food trucks to choose from a particular latitude and longitude.

San Francisco's food truck open dataset (csv) is included in this [repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glauber-silva/food-truck-anywhere/main/food-truck-data.csv).
